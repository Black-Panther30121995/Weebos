    description: `From the new hit WEBTOON series, The Mafia Nanny follows Davina on her first assignment out of the Elite Nanny Academy: protect the young son of notorious mafia underboss, Gabriel Angelini. 
    Being an Elite Nanny is simple: protect the charge, obey the principle, and don't get emotionally attached. 
    This is easier said than done when Davina's first client is a dangerously compelling Venetian underboss who's determined to get under her skin. What he wants from her, she can't imagine, but Gabriel Angelini drags her back into the glittering world of organized crime she thought she'd left behind forever. She might get answers about her past if she digs deep enough, but her challenges will be protecting Mikey from his father's ambitions and keeping her heart from getting tangled up in their treacherous web.`,
